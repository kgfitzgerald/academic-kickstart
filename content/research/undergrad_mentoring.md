- **Summer 2024** (two undergraduate students): Impact of Learning Assistants on STEM Identity for Students Historically Underrepresented in STEM. Students collaborate with me to analyze survey and administrative data collected on APU students in 100-level STEM courses. This is part of [NSF Award # 2247670](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2247670&HistoricalAwards=false).

- **Summer 2024** (three undergraduate students): [Sports Content for Outreach, Research, and Education (SCORE)](https://scorenetwork.org/index.html) in data science. Students collaborate with me to analyze sports data and develop analyses into classroom activities to be used in statistics and data science courses. 

- **Summer 2023** (two undergraduate students): Visualization of meta-analytic data for education research. Students collaborated with me to design a new visualization for displaying data from large meta-analyses, and then conduct a statistical cognition experiment to evaluate the new visualization in comparison to existing visualizations used in practice. Students presented at APU's STEM Research Symposium and the [Undergraduate Student Project Competition](https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/) of the [Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/). One student research also received a competitive student travel award to present at the 2024 [Joint Statistical Meetings](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2024/) of the [American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org). 

- **Fall 2022 - Spring 2023** (two undergraduate students): APU STEM Retention & Student Performance. We partnered with APU's [Office of Institutional Research and Assessment](https://www.apu.edu/oira/) to analyze APU's data and identify barriers to retention and student success in STEM. Student researchers presented results to APU stakeholders including STEM faculty and administrators. They also presented at two external conferences: [Mathematical Association of America SoCal-Nev Section Meeting](http://sections.maa.org/socalnv/) and the [Undergraduate Student Project Competition](https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/) of the [Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/).
