- **Summer 2023** (two undergraduate students): Visualization of meta-analytic data for education research. Students collaborate with me to design a new visualization for displaying data from large meta-analyses, and then conduct a statistical cognition experiment to evaluate the new visualization in comparison to existing visualizations used in practice. 

- **Fall 2022 - Spring 2023** (two undergraduate students): APU STEM Retention & Student Performance. We partnered with APU's [Office of Institutional Research and Assessment](https://www.apu.edu/oira/) to analyze APU's data and identify barriers to retention and student success in STEM. Student researchers presented results to APU stakeholders including STEM faculty and administrators. They also presented at two external conferences: [Mathematical Association of America SoCal-Nev Section Meeting](http://sections.maa.org/socalnv/) and the [Undergraduate Student Project Competition](https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/) of the [Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/).
