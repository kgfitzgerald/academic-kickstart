The [Teaching Certificate Program](https://www.northwestern.edu/searle/initiatives/grad/teaching-certificate-program/index.html) (TCP) is a year-long professional development and pedagogical training program offered by Northwestern's [Searle Center for Advancing Learning and Teaching](https://www.northwestern.edu/searle/). I was a program participant in the 2019 - 2020 cohort and served as a Graduate Teaching Mentor for the 2020 - 2021 cohort. 

<!--As a TCP participant, I designed an interdisciplinary course, *Statistical Research: Survey Sampling & Design of Experiments*, which emphasizes statistics as an investigative process and set of tools to answer interesting social and scientific questions. It is built on the premise that most of the statistical expertise required to successfully answer such questions actually occurs in the thinking and design phase, before any data is ever collected. The course culminates in a final project in which students develop a research question that can be answered with data and demonstrate their understanding of the course material by designing a statistically valid survey or randomized experiment that can answer that question. This course project could serve as the foundation for an excellent senior thesis, should the student decide to implement the survey or experiment upon completion of the course. -->
