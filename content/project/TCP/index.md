The [Teaching Certificate Program](https://www.northwestern.edu/searle/initiatives/grad/teaching-certificate-program/index.html) (TCP) is a year-long professional development and pedagogical training program offered by Northwestern's [Searle Center for Advancing Learning and Teaching](https://www.northwestern.edu/searle/). I was a program participant in the 2019 - 2020 cohort and am serving as a Graduate Teaching Mentor for the 2020 - 2021 cohort. 

As a TCP participant, I designed an interdisciplinary course, Statistical Research: Survey Sampling & Design of Experiments, which emphasizes statistics as an intestigative process and set of tools to answer interesting social and scientific questions. It is built on the premise that most of the statistical expertise required to successfully answer such questions actually occurs in the thinking and design phase, before any data is ever collected. As such, the culminating project is to design a survey or experiment, not to implement it. Survey sampling and experimental design are fundamental to statistics â€“ and in particular how statistics is used in research - but are topics not typically covered in an introductory course. This course seeks to fill that gap.

In this statistical research course, students delve deeper into statistical methods for survey sampling and design of experiments, with an emphasis on how these methods are
applied in practice to answer social and scientific questions. The course is interdisciplinary in nature as it focuses on developing the critical thinking and statistical skills needed to thoughtfully design data collection in order to answer relevant research questions in other fields. The course culminates in a final project in which students develop a research question that can be answered with data and demonstrate their understanding of the course material by designing a statistically valid survey or randomized experiment that can answer that question. This course project could serve as the foundation for an excellent senior thesis, should the student decide to implement the survey or experiment upon completion of the course.

Students who complete this course successfully will be able to:

+ Recognize the importance of thoughtfully designed data collection and sampling methods
and articulate how they affect conclusions drawn from data
+ Assess data quality by identifying and quantifying sources of bias and uncertainty in
data
+ Critique data-based evidence presented to them in the news, social media, and academic
research, and determine when such evidence is trustworthy
+ Analyze and effectively communicate data from surveys and randomized experiments
+ Develop research questions that can be answered with data
+ Design a survey or randomized experiment that can provide a statistically valid answer
to their research question
