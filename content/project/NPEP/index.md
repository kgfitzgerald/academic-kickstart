Along with colleagues [Abby Smith](https://abbylsmith.me) and [Mena Whalen](https://menawhalen.com), I co-designed and co-taught Introduction to Social Statistics and Data Literacy at the Cook County Department of Corrections as part of the [Northwestern Prison Education Program](https://sites.northwestern.edu/npep/).
